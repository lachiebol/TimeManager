# TimeManager

Time scheduling website, allows you to create tasks, and place them in a timeline. Tasks in the timeline can be dragged around and placed into timeslots.

Created this for myself as I want to see if I can create something that helps me out in my day to day life.

## Features:

Tasks can be added to a timeline, then dragged around the timeline

Tasks can also be removed from the timeline

## Plans for the future:

This site is part of what i'm planning to implement. 

In the future I will be adding:
- Edit/Delete option for items
- Persistant storage for schedule and items (currenty all data is wiped when page reload)
- Setup for custom time ranges (at the moment it currently is 9am-5pm)
- Ability to export to google calendar
